WMR USB Controller - this is the tool to controll your WMR device parameters with comfort.

What the tool can do:
* Turn on/off your WMR device - so you can be free from playing with the USB port everytime.
* Disable/enable virtual screens.
* Control a sleep mode's parameters (like delay before sleep and turn on/off the screensaver mode).
